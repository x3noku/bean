# Bean Monorepo

## About

Ever wondered how to migrate your T3 application into a monorepo? Stop right here! This is the perfect starter repo to get you running with the perfect stack!

It uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org) and contains:

> In this template, we use `@bean` as a placeholder for package names. As a user, you might want to replace it with your own organization or project name. You can use find-and-replace to change all the instances of `@bean` to something like `@my-company` or `@project-name`. There is a pnpm script to do this for you via `pnpm rename <name_instead_of_bean>`

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup dependencies

-   Node.js, version `22.11.0` or higher
-   PNPM, version `10.2.1`

```bash
# Use required Node version if using NVM
nvm use

# Use required pnpm version
corepack enable

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Drizzle schema to the database
pnpm db:push
```

### 2. Configuring Next-Auth to work with Expo

In order to get Next-Auth to work with Expo, you must either:

#### Deploy the Auth Proxy (RECOMMENDED)

In [apps/auth-proxy](./apps/auth-proxy) you can find a Nitro server that proxies OAuth requests. By deploying this and setting the `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` environment variable to the URL of this proxy, you can get OAuth working in preview deployments and development for Expo apps. See more deployment instructions in the [auth proxy README](./apps/auth-proxy/README.md).

By using the proxy server, the Next.js apps will forward any auth requests to the proxy server, which will handle the OAuth flow and then redirect back to the Next.js app. This makes it easy to get OAuth working since you'll have a stable URL that is publically accessible and doesn't change for every deployment and doesn't rely on what port the app is running on. So if port 3000 is taken and your Next.js app starts at port 3001 instead, your auth should still work without having to reconfigure the OAuth provider.

#### Add your local IP to your OAuth provider

You can alternatively add your local IP (e.g. `192.168.x.y:$PORT`) to your OAuth provider. This may not be as reliable as your local IP may change when you change networks. Some OAuth providers may also only support a single callback URL for each app making this approach unviable for some providers (e.g. GitHub).

### 3a. When it's time to add a new UI component

Run the `ui-add` script to add a new UI component using the interactive `shadcn/ui` CLI:

```bash
pnpm ui-add
```

When the component(s) has been installed, you should be good to go and start using it in your app.

### 3b. When it's time to add a new package

To add a new package, simply run `pnpm turbo gen init` in the monorepo root. This will prompt you for a package name as well as if you want to install any dependencies to the new package (of course you can also do this yourself later).

The generator sets up the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and a `index.ts`, as well as configures all the necessary configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is created, you're ready to go build out the package.

## Deployment

### Next.js

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). If you've never deployed a Turborepo app there, don't worry, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/nextjs` folder as the root directory. Vercel's zero-config system should handle all configurations for you.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.

### Auth Proxy

The auth proxy is a Nitro server that proxies OAuth requests in preview deployments. This is required for the Next.js app to be able to authenticate users in preview deployments. The auth proxy is not used for OAuth requests in production deployments. To get it running, it's easiest to use Vercel Edge functions. See the [Nitro docs](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel#vercel-edge-functions) for how to deploy Nitro to Vercel.

Then, there are some environment variables you need to set in order to get OAuth working:

-   For the Next.js app, set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to the URL of the auth proxy.
-   For the auth proxy server, set `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` to the same as above, as well as `AUTH_DISCORD_ID`, `AUTH_DISCORD_SECRET` (or the equivalent for your OAuth provider(s)). Lastly, set `AUTH_SECRET` **to the same value as in the Next.js app** for preview environments.

Read more about the setup in [the auth proxy README](./apps/auth-proxy/README.md).
